   :hidden:

Ready-to-use binaries are available from the *Percona XtraDB Cluster* `download page <http://www.percona.com/downloads/Percona-XtraDB-Cluster-56/>`_, including:

 * ``RPM`` packages for *RHEL* 5, *RHEL* 6, and *RHEL* 7

 * *Debian* packages

 * Generic ``.tar.gz`` packages

Using Percona Software Repositories
===================================

   installation/yum_repo
   installation/apt_repo

|Percona| provides repositories for :program:`yum` (``RPM`` packages for *Red Hat*, *CentOS* and *Amazon Linux AMI*) and :program:`apt` (:file:`.deb` packages for *Ubuntu* and *Debian*) for software such as |Percona Server|, |XtraDB|, |XtraBackup|, and *Percona Toolkit*. This makes it easy to install and update your software and its dependencies through your operating system's package manager.

This is the recommend way of installing where possible.
Make sure to remove existing PXC-5.5 and PS-5.5/5.6 packages before proceeding.

``YUM``-Based Systems
---------------------

Once the repository is set up, use the following commands: ::

  $ yum install Percona-XtraDB-Cluster-56

More detailed example of the |Percona XtraDB Cluster| installation and configuration can be seen in :ref:`centos_howto` tutorial.

``DEB``-Based Systems
---------------------

Once the repository is set up, use the following commands: ::

  $ sudo apt-get install percona-xtradb-cluster-56

More detailed example of the |Percona XtraDB Cluster| installation and configuration can be seen in :ref:`ubuntu_howto` tutorial.

Prerequisites
=============

In order for |Percona XtraDB Cluster| to work correctly firewall has to be set up to allow connections on the following ports: 3306, 4444, 4567 and 4568. |Percona XtraDB Cluster| currently doesn't work with ``SELinux`` or ``apparmor`` so they should be disabled, otherwise individual nodes won't be able to communicate and form the cluster.

Initial configuration
=====================

In order to start using the |Percona XtraDB Cluster|, following options are needed in the |MySQL| configuration file :file:`my.cnf`: ::

  [mysqld]
  
  wsrep_provider — a path to Galera library.
  wsrep_cluster_address — Cluster connection URL containing the IPs of other nodes in the cluster
  wsrep_sst_method - method used for the state snapshot transfer 
  
  binlog_format=ROW - In order for Galera to work correctly binlog format should be ROW
  default_storage_engine=InnoDB - MyISAM storage engine has only experimental support
  innodb_autoinc_lock_mode=2 - This changes how InnoDB autoincrement locks are managed

Additional parameters to specify: ::

  wsrep_sst_auth=user:password   

If any other :ref:`state_snapshot_transfer` method beside the :program:`rsync` is specified in the :variable:`wsrep_sst_method`, credentials for |SST| need to be specified.

Example: ::

  wsrep_provider=/usr/lib64/libgalera_smm.so
  wsrep_cluster_address=gcomm://10.11.12.206
  wsrep_slave_threads=8
  wsrep_sst_method=rsync
  binlog_format=ROW
  default_storage_engine=InnoDB
  innodb_autoinc_lock_mode=2

Detailed list of variables can be found in :ref:`wsrep_system_index` and :ref:`wsrep_status_index`.
