.. _wsrep_status_index:

=================================
 Index of wsrep status variables
=================================

.. variable:: wsrep_local_state_uuid
  
This variable contains :term:`UUID` state stored on the node.

.. variable:: wsrep_protocol_version
  
Version of the wsrep protocol used. 

.. variable:: wsrep_last_committed
  
Sequence number of the last committed transaction. 

.. variable:: wsrep_replicated
  
Total number of writesets sent to other nodes.

.. variable:: wsrep_replicated_bytes
  
Total size (in bytes) of writesets sent to other nodes.

.. variable:: wsrep_repl_keys

Total number of keys replicated.

.. variable:: wsrep_repl_keys_bytes

Total size (in bytes) of keys replicated.

.. variable:: wsrep_repl_data_bytes

Total size (in bytes) of data replicated.

.. variable:: wsrep_repl_other_bytes

Total size of other bits replicated.

.. variable:: wsrep_received
  
Total number of writesets received from other nodes. 

.. variable:: wsrep_received_bytes
  
Total size (in bytes) of writesets received from other nodes.

.. variable:: wsrep_local_commits
  
Number of writesets commited on the node.

.. variable:: wsrep_local_cert_failures
  
Number of writesets that failed the certification test.

.. variable:: wsrep_local_replays
  
Number of transaction replays due to "asymmetric lock granularity".

.. variable:: wsrep_local_send_queue
  
Current length of the send queue. Show the number of writesets waiting to be sent. 

.. variable:: wsrep_local_send_queue_avg
  
Average length of the send queue since the last status query. When cluster experiences network throughput issues or replication throttling this value will be significantly bigger than ``0``.

.. variable:: wsrep_local_recv_queue
  
Current length of the receive queue. Show the number of writesets waiting to be applied. 

.. variable:: wsrep_local_recv_queue_avg
  
Average length of the receive queue since the last status query. When this number is bigger than ``0`` this means node can't apply writesets as fast as they're received. This could be sign that node is overloaded and it will cause the replication throttling. 

.. variable:: wsrep_local_cached_downto

This variable shows the lowest sequence number in gcache. This information can be helpful with determining IST and/or SST. If the value is 18446744073709551615, then it means there are no writesets in cached in gcache (usual for a single node).

.. variable:: wsrep_flow_control_paused_ns

The total time spent in a paused state measured in nanoseconds.

.. variable:: wsrep_flow_control_paused
  
Time since the last status query that replication was paused due to flow control.

.. variable:: wsrep_flow_control_sent
  
Number of ``FC_PAUSE`` events sent since the last status query.

.. variable:: wsrep_flow_control_recv
  
Number of ``FC_PAUSE`` events sent and received since the last status query.

.. variable:: wsrep_cert_deps_distance
  
Average distance between highest and lowest sequence number that can be possibly applied in parallel.

.. variable:: wsrep_apply_oooe
  
This variable shows parallelization efficiency, how often writests have been applied out-of-order. 

.. variable:: wsrep_apply_oool

This variable shows how often was writeset with higher sequence number applied before the one with lower sequence number.
  
.. variable:: wsrep_apply_window
  
Average distance between highest and lowest concurrently applied sequence number.

.. variable:: wsrep_commit_oooe
  
This variable shows how often a transaction has been applied out of order.

.. variable:: wsrep_commit_oool
  
This variable currently isn't being used.

.. variable:: wsrep_commit_window
  
Average distance between highest and lowest concurrently committed sequence number.

.. variable:: wsrep_local_state
  
This variable shows internal Galera state number. Possible values are:
 * 1 - Joining (requesting/receiving State Transfer) - node is joining the cluster
 * 2 - Donor/Desynced - node is the donor to the node joining the cluster
 * 3 - Joined - node has joined the cluster
 * 4 - Synced - node is synced with the cluster

.. variable:: wsrep_local_state_comment
  
Description of the :variable:`wsrep_local_state` variable.

.. variable:: wsrep_cert_index_size
  
This variable shows the number of entries in the certification index.

.. variable:: wsrep_causal_reads_

Shows the number of writesets processed while the variable :variable:`wsrep_causal_reads` was set to ``ON``.

.. variable:: wsrep_incoming_addresses

Shows the comma-separated list of incoming node addresses in the cluster.

.. variable:: wsrep_evs_repl_latency

This status variable provides the information regarding the group communication replication latency. This latency is measured from the time point when a message is sent out to the time point when a message is received.
  
.. variable:: wsrep_evs_delayed

List of UUIDs of the evicted nodes.

.. variable:: wsrep_evs_evict_list

Comma separated list of nodes that are considered delayed. The node format is ``<uuid>:<address>:<count>`` where ``<count>`` is the number of entries on delayed list for that node.

.. variable:: wsrep_evs_state

Internal EVS protocol state.

.. variable:: wsrep_cluster_conf_id

Number of cluster membership changes happened.
  
.. variable:: wsrep_cluster_size
  
Current number of nodes in the cluster. 

.. variable:: wsrep_cluster_state_uuid
  
This variable contains :term:`UUID` state of the cluster. When this value is the same as the one in :variable:`wsrep_local_state_uuid` node is synced with the cluster.

.. variable:: wsrep_cluster_status

Status of the cluster component. Possible values are:
  * ``Primary`` -
  * ``Non-Primary`` -
  * ``Disconnected`` -
  
.. variable:: wsrep_connected

This variable shows if the node is connected to the cluster. If the value is OFF, the node has not yet connected to any of the cluster components. This may be due to misconfiguration. 
  
.. variable:: wsrep_local_bf_aborts
  
Number of local transactions that were aborted by slave transactions while being executed.

.. variable:: wsrep_local_index
  
Node index in the cluster 

.. variable:: wsrep_provider_name
  
Name of the wsrep provider (usually ``Galera``).

.. variable:: wsrep_provider_vendor
  
Name of the wsrep provider vendor (usually ``Codership Oy``)

.. variable:: wsrep_provider_version
  
Current version of the wsrep provider.

.. variable:: wsrep_ready
  
This variable shows if node is ready to accept queries. If status is ``OFF`` almost all the queries will fail with ``ERROR 1047 (08S01) Unknown Command`` error (unless :variable:`wsrep_on` variable is set to ``0``)
