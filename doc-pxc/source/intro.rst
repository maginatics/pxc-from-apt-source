 About Percona XtraDB Cluster
==============================

*Percona XtraDB Cluster* is open-source, free |MySQL| High Availability software 

General introduction
====================

1. The Cluster consists of Nodes. Recommended configuration is to have at least 3 nodes, but you can make it running with 2 nodes as well.
2. Each Node is regular |MySQL| / |Percona Server| setup. The point is that you can convert your existing MySQL / Percona Server into Node and roll Cluster using it as a base. Or otherwise – you can detach Node from Cluster and use it as just a regular server.
3. Each Node contains the full copy of data. That defines XtraDB Cluster behavior in many ways. And obviously there are benefits and drawbacks.

Benefits of such approach:
 * When you execute a query, it is executed locally on the node. All data is available locally, no need for remote access.
 * No central management. You can loose any node at any point of time, and the cluster will continue to function.
 * Good solution for scaling a read workload. You can put read queries to any of the nodes.

Drawbacks:
 * Overhead of joining new node. The new node has to copy full dataset from one of existing nodes. If it is 100GB, it copies 100GB.
 * This can't be used as an effective write scaling solution. There might be some improvements in write throughput when you run write traffic to 2 nodes vs all traffic to 1 node, but you can't expect a lot. All writes still have to go on all nodes.
 * You have several duplicates of data, for 3 nodes – 3 duplicates.

What is core difference Percona XtraDB Cluster from MySQL Replication ?
=======================================================================

Let's take look into the well known CAP theorem for Distributed systems.
Characteristics of Distributed systems:

 C - Consistency (all your data is consistent on all nodes),

 A - Availability  (your system is AVAILABLE to handle requests in case of  failure of one or several nodes ),

 P - Partitioning  tolerance (in case of inter-node connection failure, each node is still available to handle requests).


CAP theorem says that each Distributed system can have only two out of these three.

|MySQL| replication has: Availability and Partitioning tolerance.

|Percona XtraDB Cluster| has: Consistency and Availability.

That is |MySQL| replication does not guarantee Consistency of your data, while |Percona XtraDB Cluster| provides data Consistency (but it loses Partitioning tolerance property).

Components
==========

|Percona XtraDB Cluster| is based on `Percona Server with XtraDB <http://www.percona.com/software/percona-server/>`_
and includes `Write Set Replication patches <https://launchpad.net/codership-mysql>`_.
It uses  the  `Galera library <https://launchpad.net/galera>`_, version 3.x, 
a generic Synchronous Multi-Master replication plugin for transactional applications. 

Galera library is developed by `Codership Oy <http://www.galeracluster.com/>`_.

Galera 3.x supports such new features as:
 * Incremental State Transfer (|IST|), especially useful for WAN deployments,
 * RSU, Rolling Schema Update. Schema change does not block operations against table.
